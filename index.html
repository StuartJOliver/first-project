        <q>Discovering CodeClub helped to <br>
        give me the confidence to start <br>
        learning code. <br>
        I was able to study around <br>
        looking after my children and 
        working my part-time job. <br>
        I'm so grateful for this service!

    <q>I have always wanted to learn <br>
        how to code, but i never knew <br>
        where to start. <br>
        CodeClub allowed me to study at <br>
        my own pace, create projects to <br>
        add to my portfolio and earn <br>
        certificates to add onto my CV. <br>
        Thanks to CodeClub, I earned my <br>
        first job within tech!
